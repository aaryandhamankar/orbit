### Smart Campus Ride Pooling & Safety Platform

**ORBIT** is a student-first ride pooling platform built specifically for college campuses to make daily commuting safer, cheaper, greener, and more social.

Designed with a dual-role system (**Driver ↔ Rider**), ORBIT focuses on trust, real-time coordination, and campus-specific mobility rather than generic city-wide ride sharing.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Daily campus travel today is:
*   **Expensive** — heavy dependence on autos and cabs
*   **Unsafe** — especially during late-night commutes
*   **Environmentally wasteful** — single-occupancy rides dominate
*   **Unstructured** — no trusted, campus-only ride pooling system

Most existing solutions are city-focused and generic, lacking:
*   Campus-level trust
*   Safety-first design
*   Flexibility for student use cases

## 💡 Our Solution

**ORBIT** creates a campus-only ride pooling ecosystem where students can:
*   Offer or join rides instantly
*   Seamlessly switch between Driver and Rider modes
*   Track rides live on a map
*   Access SOS and safety tools
*   Save money while reducing their CO₂ footprint
